# Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

A multi-user drawing application with real-time synchronization using WebSockets. Multiple users can draw simultaneously on the same canvas with instant updates.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time drawing synchronization across all connected users
- Drawing tools: Brush, eraser, color picker, stroke width adjustment
- Global undo/redo operations (synchronized across users)
- User cursors visible to all participants
- Online user indicators with unique color assignments
- Custom canvas implementation (no external drawing libraries)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Ojas-Mahajan/FlameApp_Assign.git
cd FlameApp_Assign

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
cd server
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Start client
cd client
npm start
# Client opens at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🧪 Testing with Multiple Users

### Local Testing:
- Open the app in multiple browser windows/tabs or use incognito mode
- Start drawing - you'll see real-time synchronization

### Network Testing:
- Find your local IP (`ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux)
- Update WebSocket URL in client to your IP address
- Access from other devices on the same network

### Test Features:
- Drawing with different colors and stroke widths
- Eraser functionality
- Global undo/redo operations
- User cursor tracking
- Multiple simultaneous users (3+)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Initial sync for new users may be slow with extensive canvas drawings
2. Mobile touch events less smooth than desktop experience
3. High latency (>200ms) causes noticeable delays
4. Rapid concurrent undo operations may occasionally cause sync issues
5. Tested primarily on Chrome/Firefox; Safari may have minor differences
